Protection
----------
Most files are protected. Not because I do want to hide my stuff, but to prevent accidental edits, as it voids the digital signature. If you want to have a look at the code or change the sheets, use **1234** as password for unlocking

Also when downloading these excel files you might need to right click it first, select "properties" and the on the lower right, click on "allow" if it is present

ExcelPlayer
===========

This is an Excel sheet, that plays Video and Audio files you have the codec for. Useful if at work and you are monitored, as the playback (even the video window) counts as excel usage.

Utilizes macros.

How To
------
Open the File and confirm the security bar on top.
Go into the playlist sheet and add files. The easiest way to accomplish this, is to right click on a media file on your computer while holding shift. Select "copy as path" from the menu, than paste the path into excel. **For now, remove the quotes** of the file.

MazeGen
=======
A Maze generator and solving assistant

Allows you to generate and solve mazes

Utilizes macros.
Now with better Movement. You only need to decide crossways, the computer follows corridors and corners on it's own.

How To
------

Allow Macros, then you should see a Tab "Add-Ins" in the ribbon with 3 new buttons.
Those are in the order from left to right:

- Generate new maze
- Reset solving progress
- Clear document

Click on Clear document, then on "Generate maze".
Enter width and height of the maze.
The maze generates now. If you enter big values (>150),
excel may freeze up. Just wait for it to finish to become responsive again.

After the maze is generated, use the arrow keys to navigate through the maze.
The computer will autmatically move as far until another decision is needed
(crossing, corner or dead end)

You can reset the progress at anytime with the reset button.

You cannot save the maze at the moment.
You can save the document, but you cannot continue to solve the maze.
The reset button should however allow you to solve the already present maze again.
